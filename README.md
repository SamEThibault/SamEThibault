<p>My name is Sam and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science - BASc focused in Computer Engineering from Queen's University. Currently in my 4th year of studies, I'm actively looking for post-graduate opportunities in the fields of DevOps and backend web development.

I'm passionate about systems design and its impacts on the scalability and reliability of large-scale applications.

I've been working on my technical skills for over 4 years and have recently put my full-stack experience to use by participating in the MLH Production Engineering Fellowship, local hackathons, capture the flag events, and engineering design clubs such as QMIND and Queen's Racing.
