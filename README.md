<p>I’m Samuel Emard-Thibault, an aspiring Software Engineer in my 5th year of a Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Engineering at Queen’s University.

Over the past five years, I’ve honed my technical and problem-solving skills through hands-on experience in diverse roles and projects. As a Software Developer Intern at the Centre for Advanced Computing, I contributed to impactful solutions, while the MLH Production Engineering Fellowship enhanced my expertise in building resilient infrastructure. Beyond academics, I’ve immersed myself in hackathons, capture-the-flag competitions, and engineering clubs like QMIND and Queen's Racing, where collaboration and innovation drive success.
